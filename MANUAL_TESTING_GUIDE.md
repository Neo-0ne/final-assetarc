# Manual Testing Guide

This guide provides instructions for manually testing the features developed, as the automated verification steps were blocked by issues in the sandbox environment.

## Part 1: Verifying the `eng-billing` Backend Unit Tests

The new unit tests for the Yoco integration were failing in the development environment due to a suspected caching or file system issue, causing a persistent `NameError` even after the code was corrected.

Please run the following commands to verify the tests in a clean environment.

### Steps:

1.  **Start the `eng-billing` service:**
    ```bash
    sudo docker compose -f docker-compose.integrated.yml up -d --build eng-billing
    ```

2.  **Execute the test suite:**
    ```bash
    sudo docker compose -f docker-compose.integrated.yml exec eng-billing python -m unittest discover tests
    ```

### Expected Outcome:

The command should run and report that all **12 tests passed**.

```

Ran 12 tests in ...s

OK
```

## Part 2: Verifying the Frontend KPI Dashboard

The automated Playwright screenshot generation was blocked because the sandbox environment is missing the required system dependencies to run browsers.

You can verify the frontend change manually by following these steps.

### Steps:

1.  **Start the `eng-billing` backend service:** This service provides the API that the dashboard consumes.
    ```bash
    sudo docker compose -f docker-compose.integrated.yml up -d --build eng-billing
    ```

2.  **(Optional) Seed the database with sample data:** The dashboard will work with an empty database (showing R 0.00), but if you want to see it display values, you can execute the following command to insert two sample transactions.
    ```bash
    sudo docker compose -f docker-compose.integrated.yml exec eng-billing sqlite3 eng_billing.db "INSERT INTO transactions (id, user_id, yoco_checkout_id, amount_total, currency, product_description, transaction_status, created_at) VALUES ('pay_1', 'user1', 'co_1', 10000, 'ZAR', 'p1', 'completed', '2023-01-01 10:00:00'), ('pay_2', 'user2', 'co_2', 15000, 'ZAR', 'p2', 'completed', '2023-01-01 11:00:00');"
    ```

3.  **Open the PHP file in a browser:** This is a WordPress theme file, but for this verification, you can open it directly as a local file in your web browser (e.g., Chrome or Firefox). Navigate to the following path on your local machine:
    `[path-to-your-project-folder]/assetarc-theme/templates/template-metrics.php`

### Expected Outcome:

-   The page should display the title **"Platform Metrics Dashboard (MVP)"**.
-   You will see two cards: **"Total Revenue"** and **"Total Transactions"**.
-   After a brief "Loading..." message, the cards should update.
    -   If you did **not** seed the database, they will show **R 0.00** and **0**.
    -   If you **did** seed the database, they will show **R 250.00** and **2**.

This confirms that the JavaScript in the file is successfully calling the backend API and displaying the data.
