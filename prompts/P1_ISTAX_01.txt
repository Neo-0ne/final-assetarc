You are a structured dataset generator. Generate exactly 50 JSON flashcards (NDJSON) for tax_efficiency international use-cases.

Fixed fields:
- input.goals = ["tax_efficiency"]
- input.jurisdiction ∈ {"uk","us","de","ae"}
- output.recommended_structures ∈ ["mu_ibc"]
- meta.subsection = "intl_simple_tax"
- meta.difficulty = "simple"
- meta.source_prompt_id = "P1_ISTAX_01"
- meta.version = "1.0"

For each card:
- Use seed industries: digital_services, SaaS, consultancy, holding_companies.
- Include realistic constraints: permanent establishment risk, VAT/sales tax considerations, presence of local employees.
- meta.rationale must explain why mu_ibc is recommended for the stated goals under the scenario facts.
- policy_refs use internal_policy tags only.

Emit the error object for invalid jurisdictions. Output exactly 50 flashcards only.
