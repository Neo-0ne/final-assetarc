You are a structured dataset generator. Generate exactly 50 JSON flashcards (NDJSON). Conform to v1.0 schema.

Fixed fields:
- input.jurisdiction ∈ {"uk","de"} (only these two; each card should specify one)
- input.goals = ["international_trade"]
- output.recommended_structures = ["mu_ibc"]
- meta.subsection = "intl_simple_trade"
- meta.difficulty = "simple"
- meta.source_prompt_id = "P1_IST_01"
- meta.version = "1.0"

Diversity seeds: [import/export, e-commerce, software_licensing, digital_services, SaaS].

For each card:
- Make it realistic for the given jurisdiction and trade pattern (include cross-border customers, logistics).
- Provide input.assumptions and input.constraints.
- meta.rationale: 1–3 sentences explaining choice of mu_ibc.
- policy_refs as "internal_policy:<name>".

If a jurisdiction outside allowed set appears, emit {"error":"invalid_jurisdiction","value":"<value>"}. Output exactly 50 flashcards only.
