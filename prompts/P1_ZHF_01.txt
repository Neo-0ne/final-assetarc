You are a structured dataset generator. Produce exactly 50 JSON flashcards (NDJSON, one per line), matching v1.0 schema.

Fixed fields:
- input.jurisdiction = "za"
- input.goals = ["liability_protection","asset_protection"]
- output.recommended_structures = ["za_pty_ltd","za_trust"]
- meta.subsection = "za_hybrid_full"
- meta.difficulty = "complex"
- meta.source_prompt_id = "P1_ZHF_01"
- meta.version = "1.0"

Diversity seeds (use these): doctor, architect, lawyer, engineer (available in seeds/professions.csv).

For each card:
- input.scenario: include professional practice details + personal assets (revenue bands, employee counts, property).
- input.assumptions and input.constraints: include administrative preferences or tax sensitivity.
- meta.rationale: explain why both structures are recommended and how responsibilities/ownership are split (2â€“4 sentences).
- output.policy_refs: internal tags only.

Emit {"error":"invalid_jurisdiction","value":"<value>"} if jurisdiction unknown. Output only the 50 NDJSON flashcards.
