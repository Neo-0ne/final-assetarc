# AssetArc White-Labeling Guide for Advisors

Welcome to the AssetArc White-Labeling Program! This guide explains how you can leverage our powerful platform under your own brand, providing a seamless experience for your clients.

---

## 1. What is White-Labeling?

The white-label feature allows you to present the AssetArc client portal, document vault, and other client-facing tools as if they were your own. When your clients log in to generate documents or access their vault, they will see **your firm's logo and branding**, not ours.

This enables you to:
-   **Strengthen Your Brand:** Maintain a consistent brand experience throughout your client's journey.
-   **Build Client Trust:** Offer a professional, integrated solution that appears as a core part of your advisory services.
-   **Leverage Our Technology:** Utilize AssetArc's powerful compliance and automation engine without the cost and complexity of building it yourself.

## 2. How It Works: Your Custom Portal

Your white-labeled portal is delivered through a custom subdomain. Once configured, you and your clients will access the platform through a unique URL:

`your-brand.asset-arc.com`

For example, if your firm is named "Acme Financial Advisors", your portal would be accessible at `acme-financial-advisors.asset-arc.com`.

All pages viewed through this address, from the login screen to the document vault, will be branded with your firm's assets.

## 3. The Setup Process

Getting your white-labeled portal set up is a simple, one-time process.

**Step 1: Contact Us**
Reach out to the AssetArc platform administrator. You will need to provide the following:

*   **Your desired Brand ID:** This will be used for your subdomain (e.g., `acme-financial-advisors`). It should be unique and contain only letters, numbers, and hyphens.
*   **Your Brand Name:** The official name of your firm (e.g., "Acme Financial Advisors").
*   **Your Logo:** A high-resolution image file (PNG, SVG, or JPG) of your company logo.
*   **(Optional) Your Primary Brand Color:** A hex code (e.g., `#0047AB`) for your primary brand color, which may be used for accents in the future.

**Step 2: Configuration**
Our team will configure your brand in our backend system and activate your unique subdomain.

**Step 3: Go-Live!**
Once configured, we will notify you that your portal is live. You can then begin directing your clients to your new branded URL.

## 4. The Client Experience

Your clients will enjoy the full power of the AssetArc platform, but with your brand front and center. When you send them an invitation or a link to the portal, they will be taken to `your-brand.asset-arc.com`, where they will see your logo in the header of every page.

This ensures a consistent and trustworthy experience, reinforcing the value of your services.
