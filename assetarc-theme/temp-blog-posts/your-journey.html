    <h1>Your AssetArc Journey: A Step-by-Step Guide</h1>
    <p>Here’s how our platform works, from the moment you land on the site to the moment you receive your final documents.</p>

    <h2>1. You start. We listen.</h2>
    <p>Click “Start Structuring” and answer a few short questions. We’ll ask just enough to understand your goals—no jargon, no overload. Whether you want to reduce your tax bill, protect personal assets, or build something offshore, we’ve got you covered.</p>

    <h2>2. We generate your intake & compliance files.</h2>
    <p>You’ll get an auto-completed Client Intake and FICA compliance pack, ready for review and signature. This means no repetitive forms and a POPIA and FICA-compliant process from the start.</p>

    <h2>3. We design your legal structure.</h2>
    <p>Based on your needs, we show you a clear, understandable structure—not legal theory. You’ll see exactly what applies and why, whether it's a Trust, a Local Company, an Offshore IBC, or a full group structure.</p>

    <h2>4. You get your documents.</h2>
    <p>The system generates everything—trust deeds, resolutions, registration forms, and even tax comparisons—all customized to your answers. Nothing is released until it’s reviewed.</p>

    <h2>5. We review. You receive.</h2>
    <p>Your files are reviewed by our legal team. Once approved, they land in your secure client vault where you can download them, request changes, or move forward to submission.</p>

    <h2>6. You choose how far to go.</h2>
    <p>Want to book a review call? Done. Want to pay in crypto? Great. Need to file offshore? We’re set up for that too. Your vault is always live, so you’ll never need to restart or resend info.</p>
