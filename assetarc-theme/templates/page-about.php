      <p class="mb-4 text-gray-300">
        "I wrote 'The Definitive Structuring Guide' because I have seen what happens when good people build good businessesâ€”but on the wrong legal foundation. Too many founders, professionals, and investors spend their lives accumulating value without securing it."
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4 text-gray-300">
        "This platform was born from that experience. It is not a motivational tool; it is a structural blueprint brought to life. We built AssetArc to transform the complex, often intimidating, world of asset protection into a logical, accessible, and transparent process."
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">
        "Our promise is simple: to provide the tools and logic you need to do things right from the start. This is where understanding becomes execution, and execution becomes protection."

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gold mb-2">To Replace Complexity with Clarity</h3>
        <p>Protection is not paperwork. It is logic. It is law. It is layered structure. We translate these principles into automated workflows that guide you through every step, ensuring you understand the 'why' behind every decision.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gold mb-2">To Make Governance Accessible</h3>
        <p>We believe robust, compliant structuring shouldn't be reserved for the ultra-rich. We provide the tools for entrepreneurs, families, and advisors to build resilient governance frameworks that protect assets across generations.</p>
