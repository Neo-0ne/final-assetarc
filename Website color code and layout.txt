🎨 Brand Colors (as code tokens + usage)

Core palette

Gold gradient (primary): #B78628 → #FFD700 (metallic) — headings, CTAs, accents, hover states. 

Bronze (gradient start): #8C6239 — left/early stops in gradients, borders. 

Black (background): #000000 — global background / header / footer. 

White (content blocks): #FFFFFF — cards, text blocks for readability. 

Soft Silver (accents): #D3D3D3 — thin dividers, subtle UI lines. 

CSS variables (present in style.css)

:root{
  --gold-light:#FFD700; --gold-med:#B78628; --gold-dark:#8C6239;
  --white:#ffffff; --black:#000000;
}


(Used across header, nav, main, buttons, cards.) 

Gradient utility (custom CSS)
You also have a reusable class example for gold gradient buttons:

.btn-gold{background:linear-gradient(135deg,#8C6239,#B78628,#FFD700);color:#fff}


🔤 Typography

Headings (serif): Playfair Display or Cormorant Garamond for premium/legal tone. 

Body (sans-serif): Inter, Lato, or Source Sans Pro for clarity. 

Buttons/CTAs: Inter SemiBold / Lato Bold. 

The base style.css demo used Georgia as a serif fallback (can be swapped to your final font stack). 

🧱 Layout System & Page Structure

Global layout choices

Dark shell with light cards: Dark charcoal/black background with white content blocks for readability (premium hybrid style). 

Card UI: .card{ background:#1a1a1a; border:1px solid var(--gold-dark); border-radius:16px; box-shadow:0 0 15px rgba(255,215,0,.1) } (mobile rules included). 

Responsive: Header/main padding adjustments and flexible nav on sub-768px. 

Primary templates (present/defined)

front-page.php (home), page-*.php for about/services/pricing/education/consultation/login, vault-access.php, white-label.php, webhook-handler.php, plus core: style.css, functions.php, header.php, footer.php, index.php. 

Custom dashboards via /templates: template-dashboard.php, template-metrics.php, template-review.php, template-vault.php (must have WP template headers). 

Home/index behavior

index.php centers hero, shows gold CTAs, routes to Client Intake, Advisor, Consultation, Education. Requires a gold color token if using Tailwind utilities as shown. 

🧭 Navigation, Header & Footer

Header

Black header, gold logo/text, nav links gold→white on hover. 

White-label aware: header.php detects subdirectory brand and loads logo/name from environment (e.g., BRAND_X_NAME/LOGO). 

Footer

Black footer, subtle gold-dark top border, muted text; matches header styling. 

🧩 Components (ready styles)

Buttons: Gold background, black text; hover → lighter gold. (You requested black outline + gold text invert as a variant; base demo shows filled gold—keep both variants.) 

Pricing Cards, Trust Strip, Bot Panel Grid, Sticky CTA — CSS blocks prepared for the premium look (gold accents, shadows, hover elevate). 

👤 Advisor / White-Label Behavior

Subdirectory routing (/advisorX) for brand override (logo/colors/meta) — Option A (single WP install) is recommended for scale. 

White-label loader proposed in white-label.php: detect subdir, pull branding JSON/DB, override tokens, assets, tags. 

Advisor dashboard shows token usage, pending reviews, links to white-label settings & metrics. 

🔐 Auth, Vault & Redirects (functions)

Login redirect: logged-in users auto-land on /vault. 

Hide admin bar for non-admins. 

Shortcode [advisor_brand] exposes detected brand name in content blocks. 

⚙️ Theme Bootstrap & Enqueues

Theme header (required!): Valid metadata block at top of style.css. (Fix for the earlier WP install error.) 

Enqueue CSS/JS: functions.php should enqueue /css/custom.css and /js/script.js (token forms, AJAX, modals). 

Folder map (final): css/, js/, templates/, core PHP files, screenshot.png. 

Screenshot preview: place screenshot.png (1200×900) so the theme previews correctly in WP Admin. 

🧪 Blog & Single posts

Blog posts route via single.php (you asked for it among remaining files); blog uses standard loop + theme styles. The doc notes /sample-post/ → single.php. 

🖇️ Integration Points (Flask/bots/FX/etc.)

Webhook→Flask: webhook-handler.php to connect forms to bot backend. 

Vault gate: vault-access.php for secure doc preview/release after human review. 

Token UI/logic: in JS (validation) + functions (hold/deduct/release) + advisor dashboard templates. 

Dynamic gold token (Tailwind optional): If using Tailwind utilities in index.php, make sure gold is defined in tailwind.config.js. 

✅ What to double-check in your repo (fast audit list)

style.css header present at top; color tokens/typography consistent. 

functions.php enqueues /css/custom.css & /js/script.js and contains login redirect + admin-bar hide + shortcode. 
 

Templates renamed .php with valid headers (Dashboard/Metrics/Review/Vault). 

White-label detect/override in white-label.php + header.php brand loader. 
 

Index/Home hero CTAs and routes match your paths; Tailwind token defined if used. 

Blog has single.php wired (per /sample-post/). 

Screenshot present at 1200×900. 

If you want, I can package this as a theme “spec sheet” PDF and/or regenerate the theme ZIP with all pages, CSS tokens, white-label loader, and missing files (e.g., single.php, newsletter-handler.php, review-flag-router.php) filled in exactly to these specs for one-click upload.

Provide a [bot_grid] shortcode to render cards from a JSON/ACF list (title, icon, description, link).

Make Front Page a static page using front-page.php.

Keep images light; add a 1200×900 screenshot.png for theme preview.

Add a home.css partial to scope section styles: #hero, #trust-strip, #how-it-works, #paths, #bots, #lead-magnet, #compliance, #testimonials, #pricing, #resources, #cta-final.

If you want, I can turn this into a ready-to-import Gutenberg template (JSON) or a front-page.php skeleton with ACF fields wired up so your team can drop it in and tweak copy/images.

You said:
I don't see any reference to the video above the fold.
ChatGPT said:

You’re right — in my previous home page layout I included the visual/demo illustration in the hero, but I didn’t spell out the video “above the fold” treatment. Let me fix that and set out exactly how it fits.

🎥 Hero Section with Video (Above the Fold)

Purpose: Immediately convey what AssetArc does — show the system generating compliant documents with review overlay. This reduces bounce and builds trust.

Layout (Desktop)

Left column (60%)

H1: “Asset Protection & Tax Structuring, Automated — With Human Review”

Subheading: “Generate trust deeds, company setups, and SARS s42–47 compliant drafts. Always human-checked before release.”

Primary CTA (gold button): “Start Free Assessment”

Secondary CTA (outlined gold): “See How It Works” → scroll to “How it Works” section.

Right column (40%)

Embedded video (hero video)

Plays muted auto-loop (20–30s demo, no audio by default)

Styled in a rounded card with gold outline/shadow

Hover = light gold glow

Click expands to lightbox/full-screen playback

Layout (Mobile)

Stacked vertically

Video first (full-width, aspect ratio 16:9, autoplay muted)

Headline + Subheadline + CTAs below it

Content of Video

20–30s loop:

Selecting a bot (Trust Setup / SARS s47)

Input screen → compliance logic firing (PEP flag, 70% rule)

Draft document preview with watermark

“Human Review” overlay ticked

Secure Vault icon / “Resume Journey” login demo

Overlay text snippets (in gold, fade in/out):

“Select your bot”

“Logic applied: FICA + SARS 47”

“Draft generated”

“Reviewed before release”

Technical WordPress Implementation

In front-page.php hero block:

<div class="hero">
  <div class="hero-left">
    <h1><?php the_field('hero_headline'); ?></h1>
    <p><?php the_field('hero_sub'); ?></p>
    <a class="btn-gold" href="/assessment">Start Free Assessment</a>
    <a class="btn-outline" href="#how-it-works">See How It Works</a>
  </div>
  <div class="hero-right">
    <video autoplay muted loop playsinline class="hero-video">
      <source src="<?php the_field('hero_video'); ?>" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
  </div>
</div>


Custom Fields (ACF):

hero_headline

hero_sub

hero_video (upload field for MP4/WebM)

CSS styling:

.hero-video {
  border-radius: 20px;
  border: 2px solid var(--gold-light);
  box-shadow: 0 0 20px rgba(255,215,0,0.2);
  max-width: 100%;
}

Positioning in Flow

The hero is the above-the-fold area.

Video is right-aligned desktop, full-width mobile.

Immediately below: Trust strip (logos), then “How It Works”.

✅ This ensures the video demo is part of the first visual impression — not buried — while keeping CTAs clear.
