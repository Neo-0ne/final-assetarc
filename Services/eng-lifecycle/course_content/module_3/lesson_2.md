## Lesson 2: Sequencing Your Structure for Success

In structuring, *what* you build is important, but *when* you build it is critical. Many costly structuring failures happen because the entities were created in the wrong order.

Getting the sequence right from the start ensures that you can move assets, manage profits, and grow your business without triggering unnecessary taxes or creating legal headaches.

### The Correct Sequence: Top-Down

Always build your structure from the top down. Think of it like building a house: you start with the foundation and frame, not the furniture.

**The Golden Path:**

1.  **Step 1: Create Your Trust.** This is the ultimate owner and control layer. It should be the very first thing you establish, as it needs to own everything else.
2.  **Step 2: Create Your Holding Company (HoldCo).** The Trust will be the sole shareholder of the HoldCo from the moment it is created.
3.  **Step 3: Create Your Operating and Asset Companies (OpCo/IPCo).** The HoldCo will be the shareholder of these entities.

**Why this order is crucial:**
By setting up the Trust and HoldCo first, any assets or business ventures you create can be placed directly into the correct, protected entity from day one. There is no need to transfer ownership later, which can be complex and costly.

### The Common Mistake: Building from the Bottom-Up

This is the trap many entrepreneurs fall into.

**The Path of Most Resistance:**

1.  You start a business and register an Operating Company (OpCo) in your own name.
2.  The business becomes successful and valuable.
3.  You realize your ownership is personally exposed, so you decide you need a Trust and a HoldCo.
4.  Now, you have to *transfer* the shares of your valuable OpCo from your name to the HoldCo, and the HoldCo's shares to the Trust.

**Why this is a problem:**
Transferring a valuable asset (like the shares in your successful company) can be considered a "disposal" by the tax authorities. This can trigger immediate Capital Gains Tax (CGT) on the growth of the company's value. You could face a significant tax bill just for trying to organize your affairs correctly.

### A Real-World Example of a Sequencing Failure

Thabo, an entrepreneur, launched a software company (OpCo) and owned the shares personally. It became worth R5 million. When he tried to move it under a HoldCo owned by his Trust, he faced a massive CGT bill on the R5 million valuation.

If he had followed the correct sequence, the Trust would have owned the HoldCo, which would have owned the OpCo from the very beginning when it was worth R0. All that growth would have occurred inside the protected structure, and there would be no tax event for simply getting organized.

**The Key Takeaway:**
Your structure should be waiting for your assets, not the other way around. By building from the top down, you create an empty, protected "bucket" (your Trust-HoldCo stack) ready to safely hold the valuable businesses and assets you create.

In the next lesson, we'll look at how you can fix sequencing mistakes or adapt your structure as you grow, without the massive tax hit.
