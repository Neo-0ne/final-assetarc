## Lesson 2: Structuring for Your Legacy: Property & Estate Planning

For many families, property—whether it's the family home or a portfolio of investments—is the most significant asset they own. But if it's structured incorrectly, it can become a huge liability for the next generation.

### The Dangers of Personal Ownership

Owning property in your own name is one of the biggest risks to your legacy. Here’s why:

1.  **Estate Duty Exposure:** When you pass away, any property in your name is part of your "dutiable estate." In South Africa, this means your heirs could face a tax bill of **20-25%** of the property's value.
2.  **Forced Asset Sales:** If your estate doesn't have enough cash to pay this tax bill, your heirs will be forced to sell the very assets you wanted them to inherit, often at a discounted price under pressure. The family home could be lost simply to pay the taxman.
3.  **Creditor Claims:** As we've discussed, any asset in your personal name is exposed to your personal or business creditors.

### The Solution: The "PropCo" Stack

The solution is to take the property out of your personal name and place it into a dedicated, protected structure. This is where the **Property Company (PropCo)** comes in.

The optimal stack for property is:
**Trust --> Owns the HoldCo --> Which owns the PropCo --> Which owns the physical property.**

**How this solves the problems:**

*   **Estate Duty Neutralized:** The property is owned by the PropCo, not you. Therefore, it does not fall into your personal estate upon your death. There is no Estate Duty payable on the property's value. Your legacy passes to the next generation without a massive tax leakage.
*   **No Forced Sales:** Since there is no huge tax bill to pay, your heirs are not forced to sell the property.
*   **Full Asset Protection:** The property is shielded from any personal or business-related creditor claims. It is safely housed in its own protected entity.

### Planning for Liquidity

Even with a perfect structure, your estate might have some taxes to pay. Smart structuring plans for this. Within your HoldCo, you can create a "liquidity fund" or use other financial tools. This ensures that when the time comes, there is available cash to settle any final expenses without ever having to touch the core assets.

**The Key Takeaway:**
Never hold significant property in your own name. By placing it in a properly designed structure, you can ensure that you are building a legacy for your family, not a tax burden. This is one of the most powerful and immediate ways that smart structuring can protect your wealth for generations.
