## Lesson 3: Choosing Your First Structure

You don't need a complex, multi-layered structure from day one. The key is to start with the *right* foundation and then build upon it as your business and wealth grow. So, how do you choose?

It’s not about picking a structure from a list; it’s about matching a structure to your goals.

### The Three Most Important Questions to Ask Yourself

Before you do anything, answer these three questions. They will guide your decision.

1.  **What am I trying to protect?**
    *   Are you trying to shield your family home from the risks of your new business? (This points towards asset protection).
    *   Are you holding valuable assets like property or investments that you want to pass on to the next generation? (This points towards estate planning).

2.  **What is the nature of my activity?**
    *   Are you running an active business with employees, customers, and suppliers? (This is high-risk and points towards a Company).
    *   Are you simply holding passive assets, like a share portfolio or a rental property? (This is lower-risk and could be suited for a Trust).

3.  **What is my main goal right now?**
    *   Is it to limit my business liability so I can sleep at night?
    *   Is it to ensure my family is looked after if something happens to me?
    *   Is it to legally optimize my tax situation?

Your answers will point you toward the right starting point.

### Simple Structure Profiles: Which One Fits You?

Let's compare the two building blocks we've learned about.

#### A Company (Pty Ltd) is best for...

*   **Running an active business.** If you are selling products, providing services, or have employees, you need a company.
*   **Containing operational risk.** It creates a legal shield between your business activities and your personal life.
*   **Flexibility.** Companies are generally straightforward to set up and manage for day-to-day business.

**Benefit:** A company is your frontline defense for business risk.

#### A Trust is best for...

*   **Asset protection.** If your primary goal is to protect valuable assets (like property, shares, or investments) from all types of risk, a trust is the gold standard.
*   **Estate planning and legacy.** Assets in a trust are not considered part of your personal estate, which can save your family a significant amount in estate taxes and legal fees.
*   **Long-term control.** It allows you to set the rules for how your assets are managed for generations to come.

**Benefit:** A trust is your fortress for long-term wealth protection.

### The Hybrid Approach: The Ultimate Goal

While you might start with just one, the most resilient structure for anyone with both a business and personal assets is the **Hybrid Stack**:

> **A Trust that owns a Company.**

This structure gives you:
*   **The Company** to run your business and contain the day-to-day risks.
*   **The Trust** to own the company, protecting your most valuable business asset (your ownership itself) and shielding it from personal creditors and estate taxes.

**Your Action Plan:**
If you're running a business, start with a Company. If you have significant personal assets to protect, start with a Trust. Your very next step should be to plan for the hybrid model.

This completes our first module on the foundations of structuring. You now understand *why* it’s critical and what the basic building blocks are. In the next module, we will dive deeper into the Asset Protection Playbook.
